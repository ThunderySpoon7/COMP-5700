Threat Model for MinIO
This threat model for MinIO, a high-performance object-based storage server, identifies and ranks potential threats to its confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

1. Threats and Threat Events
Threats are the potential for a harmful event to occur. Threat events are the specific malicious actions that exploit vulnerabilities.

Information Disclosure:

Threat Event: Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in buckets. This can happen through misconfigured access policies, a compromised user account, or a vulnerability that allows for arbitrary file reading (like a path traversal vulnerability).

Example: A user accidentally sets a bucket policy to "public" instead of "private," exposing corporate financial records.

Data Tampering:

Threat Event: Unauthorized modification or deletion of data. An attacker with compromised credentials or a privilege escalation vulnerability could alter critical application files, business documents, or backups.

Example: An attacker modifies a backup file, making it useless for recovery, or alters a log file to cover their tracks.

Repudiation:

Threat Event: An authenticated user denies performing an action, such as deleting a bucket or a critical object.

Example: An disgruntled employee deletes a project's entire dataset and claims they didn't do it, and there are no logs to prove otherwise.

Denial of Service (DoS):

Threat Event: An attacker or a malfunctioning application overwhelms the MinIO server, making it unavailable to legitimate users. This could be a DDoS attack, a flood of write requests, or a resource exhaustion attack.

Example: A misconfigured client application goes into a loop, rapidly creating and deleting thousands of objects, consuming all available resources and making the MinIO server unresponsive.

Privilege Escalation:

Threat Event: A user with limited permissions gains unauthorized higher-level permissions, such as an administrator role. This can happen through exploiting a software vulnerability.

Example: A user with read-only access to a bucket exploits a bug in the MinIO API to grant themselves admin privileges, giving them full control over the entire system.

Spoofing:

Threat Event: An attacker successfully impersonates a legitimate user or system component to gain unauthorized access. This is often the first step in a multi-stage attack.

Example: An attacker steals a user's access key and secret key and uses them to authenticate to the MinIO server, appearing to be the legitimate user.

2. Threat Actors
Threat actors are the individuals or groups responsible for the threats.

External Adversaries: Malicious actors from outside the organization who are financially motivated (cybercriminals), ideologically motivated (hacktivists), or state-sponsored. They often seek to exfiltrate data for ransom or competitive advantage.

Insider Threats: This category includes disgruntled employees, former employees, or contractors who have (or had) authorized access. They can cause significant damage due to their knowledge of the system's inner workings.

Opportunistic Attackers: Unskilled or semi-skilled attackers who use automated scripts and scanners to find and exploit known vulnerabilities in publicly exposed MinIO instances.

Automated Malicious Scripts: Bots and scripts designed to scan the internet for misconfigured or unpatched MinIO servers. They are not human-controlled in real-time but carry out the instructions of their creators.

3. Threat Ranking
This ranking is based on a combination of likelihood (how probable is it?) and impact (how bad would it be?).

Information Disclosure (High Impact, High Likelihood):

Likelihood: High, due to common misconfigurations (e.g., publicly exposed buckets) and the availability of scanning tools. A single human error can lead to a massive data breach.

Impact: High. Data breaches can lead to significant financial loss, legal penalties, reputational damage, and loss of customer trust.

Privilege Escalation (High Impact, Medium Likelihood):

Likelihood: Medium. This often requires exploiting a specific software vulnerability (a zero-day or an unpatched CVE), which is more complex than a misconfiguration. However, when a vulnerability is public, the likelihood increases dramatically for unpatched systems.

Impact: High. A successful privilege escalation gives an attacker complete control over the MinIO instance, enabling them to execute any other threat event, including data tampering, disclosure, and denial of service.

Data Tampering (Medium Impact, Medium Likelihood):

Likelihood: Medium. This requires either an authenticated user account with write permissions or a successful privilege escalation. It's a targeted attack.

Impact: Medium to High. The impact depends on the data being tampered with. Corrupting a single backup is disruptive; corrupting a core database could be catastrophic.

Repudiation (Medium Impact, Medium Likelihood):

Likelihood: Medium. It's an internal threat that depends on a lack of proper auditing and logging. This is a design flaw rather than a direct attack on a system vulnerability.

Impact: Medium. While it doesn't directly compromise data, it complicates forensic analysis, impedes accountability, and can hinder legal proceedings.

Denial of Service (Low Impact, High Likelihood):

Likelihood: High. DoS attacks are easy to launch and often don't require high technical skill. A simple script can flood the server.

Impact: Low. While it disrupts service, it doesn't typically result in data loss or theft. Service can be restored once the attack ceases. The primary impact is operational disruption and potential revenue loss during the outage.

Spoofing (Low Impact, High Likelihood):

Likelihood: High. Credential theft is a very common attack vector.

Impact: Low. This is a stepping-stone threat. The impact of spoofing itself is minimal; the real risk lies in what the attacker does after they've spoofed a user's identity (e.g., data disclosure or tampering).
